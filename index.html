            <h1>JavaScript History</h1>
            <p>
                avaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications. Initially, it was developed in just 10 days as a lightweight scripting language to add interactivity to web pages. It was originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, but later renamed JavaScript as part of a marketing collaboration with Sun Microsystems, the creators of Java.

                JavaScript was designed to run in browsers and allowed web developers to add dynamic elements like animations, form validations, and interactive user interfaces. Over time, it evolved to become a versatile programming language that can run both on the client side (in the browser) and the server side (Node.js).

                <h2>Why JavaScript is Different from Java</h2>
                <p>Despite the name similarity, JavaScript and Java are fundamentally different languages:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Purpose:</li>
                    <ul class="unlistedcontainer">
                        <li>JavaScript was designed as a scripting language to run inside web browsers. It is mainly used for web development.</li>
                        <li>Java, on the other hand, is a general-purpose programming language used for building large-scale applications, such as enterprise software, mobile applications (Android), and more.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Execution Environment:</li>
                    <ul class="unlistedcontainer">
                        <li>JavaScript is primarily run in the browser (though it can also run on servers via Node.js).</li>
                        <li>Java is compiled to bytecode and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it platform-independent.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Type System:</li>
                    <ul class="unlistedcontainer">
                        <li>JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to specify the type of variables. Types are determined at runtime.</li>
                        <li>Java is statically typed, meaning you must define the type of every variable (e.g., int, String), and this is checked at compile-time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Syntax and Structure:</li>
                    <ul class="unlistedcontainer">
                        <li>JavaScript is prototype-based and more flexible when it comes to defining objects and inheritance.</li>
                        <li>Java is class-based, with a more rigid structure following object-oriented programming principles.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Concurrency:</li>
                    <ul class="unlistedcontainer">
                        <li>JavaScript uses an event-driven, non-blocking model, utilizing asynchronous programming (like async/await and promises) to handle multiple tasks.</li>
                        <li>Java uses multi-threading and can handle concurrency with threads, often using more system resources.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>

<h2>Key Features of JavaScript</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Lightweight &amp; Interpreted:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript can handle events like user actions (clicks, keypresses) and execute asynchronous code (e.g., fetching data from a server without blocking the rest of the application).</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Event-Driven &amp; Asynchronous:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript is an interpreted language (not compiled), meaning the code is executed line by line by the browser.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Cross-Platform:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>It runs on any platform and in any browser, making it a universal language for the web.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Dynamic Typing:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Variables can change types dynamically, giving developers more flexibility but also leading to some runtime errors.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Prototypal Inheritance:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Instead of using class-based inheritance (like Java), JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance, allowing objects to inherit properties directly from other objects.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>First-Class Functions:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Functions in JavaScript are treated as "first-class citizens," meaning they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned from functions, and assigned to variables.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>DOM Manipulation:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript can interact with the Document Object Model (DOM), allowing developers to dynamically change the content, structure, and style of web pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Ecosystem &amp; Libraries:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>With frameworks like React, Vue.js, Angular, and tools like Node.js, JavaScript has become a key technology for both front-end and back-end development.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>ECMAScript:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript follows the ECMAScript specification. ECMAScript 6 (ES6) brought many new features, such as arrow functions, template literals, modules, classes, and promises, modernizing the language.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<p>JavaScript has transformed from a simple scripting language into a powerful, full-featured programming language that drives modern web development.</p>
