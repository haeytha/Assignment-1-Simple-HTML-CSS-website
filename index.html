            <h1>JavaScript History</h1>
            <p>JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while working at Netscape Communications. Initially, it was developed in just 10 days as a lightweight scripting language to add interactivity to web pages. It was originally called Mocha, then LiveScript, but later renamed JavaScript as part of a marketing collaboration with Sun Microsystems, the creators of Java.</p>
            <p>JavaScript was designed to run in browsers and allowed web developers to add dynamic elements like animations, form validations, and interactive user interfaces. Over time, it evolved to become a versatile programming language that can run both on the client side (in the browser) and the server side (Node.js).</p>

                <h2>Why JavaScript is Different from Java</h2>
                <p>Despite the name similarity, JavaScript and Java are fundamentally different languages:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Purpose:</li>
                    <ul class="unlistedcontainer">
                        <li>JavaScript was designed as a scripting language to run inside web browsers. It is mainly used for web development.</li>
                        <li>Java, on the other hand, is a general-purpose programming language used for building large-scale applications, such as enterprise software, mobile applications (Android), and more.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Execution Environment:</li>
                    <ul class="unlistedcontainer">
                        <li>JavaScript is primarily run in the browser (though it can also run on servers via Node.js).</li>
                        <li>Java is compiled to bytecode and runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it platform-independent.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Type System:</li>
                    <ul class="unlistedcontainer">
                        <li>JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to specify the type of variables. Types are determined at runtime.</li>
                        <li>Java is statically typed, meaning you must define the type of every variable (e.g., int, String), and this is checked at compile-time.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
            </section>

                <h2>Key Features of JavaScript</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Lightweight & Interpreted:</li>
                    <ul class="unlistedcontainer">
                        <li>JavaScript can handle events like user actions (clicks, keypresses) and execute asynchronous code (e.g., fetching data from a server without blocking the rest of the application).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Event-Driven & Asynchronous:</li>
                    <ul class="unlistedcontainer">
                        <li>JavaScript is an interpreted language (not compiled), meaning the code is executed line by line by the browser.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
